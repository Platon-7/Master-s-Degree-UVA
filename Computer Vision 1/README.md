# Computer Vision 1

This course is from the Master of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam. It is part of the first block and is considered a theory-heavy course of medium difficulty. It has 5 group projects (groups of 3) that account for the 50% of the total grade. My teamates in these projects were Emma Kasteleyn and Jasper van der Valk.

# Objectives
- To become familiar with both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer vision and to describe the foundations of image formation, measurement, and analysis.
- To learn physical-, statistical-, and deep learning models as the foundation of computer vision and apply them to computer vision problems.
- To learn the fundamental aspects of different computer vision models and to explain their advantages and shortcomings.
- To be able to implement computer vision programs and evaluate/test these programs to understand the limitations of these vision algorithms.
- To learn how to develop the practical skills necessary to design, model, build, organize, and execute computer vision applications.

Digital cameras have become ubiquitous in the form of consumer cameras, webcams, mobile phones, and professional cameras. These cameras yield enormous streams of data and provide the means for communication, observation, and interaction. In this course, image understanding is addressed with the focus on core vision tasks of scene understanding and object recognition.

A broad range of computational techniques are studied on how computers can understand the visual world, including:
- Image formation and filtering
- Features (color and shape invariants, interest point detectors, descriptors, SIFT, HoG)
- Visual information representation (vector space, statistical models, Bag-of-Words)
- Learning and classification (Bag of Words)
- Deep learning (DL), object detection and classification, object tracking

The course covers a variety of modern applications such as:
- Face recognition
- Human behavior analysis
- Autonomous driving
- AIGC

Further, the course focuses on object recognition in the field of computer vision. We discuss the data, tasks, and results of Pascal VOC and ImageNet, the leading benchmarks. Additionally, we explore community initiatives in creating annotations, baselines, and software for repeatable experiments.
