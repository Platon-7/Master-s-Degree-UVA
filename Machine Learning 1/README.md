# Machine Learning 1

Machine Learning 1 is a course from the Master of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam. It is part of the first block which is considered to be the toughest one. This course demands a very good mathematic background and at least 20 hours per week in order to be able to follow the lectures and do the homework assignments.
